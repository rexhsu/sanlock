 * PERSISTENT: if the pid holding the resource lease exits,
 * the lease will not be released, but will be moved to the
 * orphans list.  On disk and from the perspective of other
 * hosts, nothing changes when a lease is orphaned; it continues
 * to be held by the host.
 *
 * (If persistent shared locks are used on a resource, then
 * all the locks on that resource should be persistent.)
 *
 * A new process can acquire an orphan resource using
 * the ACQUIRE_ORPHAN flag.  This implies that the lockspace
 * had continued running and the resource not released by the
 * host between the time the resource became an orphan and was
 * then transferred to a new process.
 *
 * Orphan impact on the lockspace: if the lockspace is stopping
 * because of rem, or lease failure, the ls config option
 * USED_BY_ORPHANS will block the release of the lockspace
 * (like the USED option), if orphans exist for the lockspace.
 * Without USED_BY_ORPHANS, the lockspace would exit and
 * leave the orphan resources unchanged (not released) on disk.
 * The unreleased orphan resources could be acquired by another
 * host if the lockspace lease is cleanly released.
